# AlwaysWithYou
Hello and welcome to AlwaysWithYou project!
Be aware that the name could change during developement...

# Presentation
Okay, so AlwaysWithYou will be a RPG. The player live in a world full of zombies. You can see that like a fangame of The Walking Dead, but this isn't really the goal.

# Way used
This project use the Qt Framework and SFML-2.4.2 library. Basically he is compiled with the MinGW gived in the installer of Qt. I have compiled the SFML from sources with this compiler so now if you want to work on this project you have to do the same thing.

This is the begining of the project!
